# Security Policy

WhereMyTokens for macOS reads local AI coding tool data and may use local provider credentials to fetch usage snapshots for enabled providers. Please report security issues privately.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Open a private security advisory on GitHub, or contact the maintainer through the repository owner profile.

Please include:

- Affected version or commit.
- Steps to reproduce.
- What local files, credentials, Keychain items, processes, or network requests are involved.
- Any logs with tokens, secrets, or personal paths redacted.

## Privacy Expectations

- No cloud sync.
- No telemetry.
- No separate credential backup.
- Provider usage requests only for enabled providers.
- Antigravity support uses loopback local RPC only.

## Supported Versions

The latest GitHub Release is the supported version for security fixes.
